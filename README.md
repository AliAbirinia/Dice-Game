🎲 Pig Game 🎲

This is a simple Pig Game implemented in JavaScript. It's a two-player game where players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. The first player to reach 50 points wins.
I built this project to practice my JavaScript skills, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic. If you enjoy rolling dice and testing your luck, give it a try! 🎲

🧠 Why I Built This

I'm an INFJ—T enjoy structure, strategy, and deep thinking. This project was more than just a game for me. It was about mastering JavaScript step by step, making the logic clean and efficient. I always aim for perfection in my work, and while no code is ever "final," this one comes close (for now). 

🏗️ Future Improvements

🎨 Improve UI/UX (Maybe add animations?)

📱 Make it fully responsive for mobile
